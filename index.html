<a  name = "ourp"><h1>Our Principles</h1>
  <p>For more than 25 years, the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy has been redefining what it means to be a public policy school, shifting the conception of public policy from an ideology, reliant on politics and pedigree, to a science, rooted in data and impact.

Today, we live in a transformative era for public policy, where this distinctive point of view is needed more than ever.

At a time when trust in public institutions is fragile, Harris is leading the way to smarter decision making and better policymaking, training a new generation of leaders who are driven to change the world and know that making a social impact requires fresh thinking and different approaches.

Five principles guide us in this important mission—to develop leaders who put evidence first—as we seek to advance policy through the best science of our day. </p>
